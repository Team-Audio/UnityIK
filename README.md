# Unity inverse Kinematics Repository

This repository contains a protoype for Inverse Kinematics in Unity.
The inverse kinematics algorithm is used to animate Hands for our Motion solver.
My implementation is based on the FABRIK algorithm explained in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1524070311000178?casa_token=F_y7icgqR2YAAAAA:u-UZ0QCQCMS-rjz9-pb0WCygWYq2dxlNq9bW2hNnieFspTAVUAv-VVU7buBqrgn967CkP5WJCgw).

I added the in the paper suggested hinge joint to simulate finger movement.


## TO DO:

- [x] Basic hand movement.

- [ ] Tweak parameters for more realistic hand movements.

- [ ] More sophisticated test environment / Piano playing test environment.
